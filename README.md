# Assignment 1: SqlToCsharp

## Description
The SQLToCsharp project focuses on creating a database for managing information about superheroes, their superpowers and their assistants. We utilized pair programming for this assignment to practice efficient development. In addition to the superhero-themed database, a part of the assignment involved working with the "Chinook" database to showcase the SQL part of the assignment, which we began with.

We started with creating the SQL database "SuperheroesDb". In the database we added the tables necessary for the assignment. The SQL part of the assignment requires the ability for creation of the superheroes, updating and deletion within the tables. After the SQL portion of the assignment was done we moved on to the development environment Visual Studio with C#. 

## Repository Pattern
The project implements the repository pattern which can be seen in Visual Studio. 

## Installation
To run the program make sure you have installed the following development environment and databasemanagement tools:
- Visual Studio 2022 with .NET 6
- SQL Server Management Studio
